# Creating an Issue Template

Creating an issue template can streamline the issue creation process and ensure that team members provide all the necessary information required for the team to be able to work on the issue.

## Create an issue template using GitHub Templates

1. Click the settings tab on the main repository for the project and scroll down to the Features section.

2. Ensure that the Issues box is checked. You should then see and be able to click the Set up templates button.

3. You can either select an existing template from the dropdown, or create your own custom template. This example shows you how to create a bug issue template, but the steps will be similar for the other options.

4. You can then preview the template by clicking the <kbd>preview and edit</kbd> button. To Edit the template, click the pencil icon. This will then allow you to edit the template name, about field, template body and also some additional items such as default title, assignees and labels. The template body uses markdown.

    You may create additional templates by selecting another template from the dropdown at the bottom of the page.

5. Once you have created your templates, click the green <kbd>Propose changes</kbd> button in the top right. This will then display a form to enable you to commit these issue templates to the repository.
