# Setting up the Repository for Social Sharing

Follow the steps below to have your repository looking its best when sharing on socials!

## Social Preview

We can customise the image used as the preview when sharing our repository link on social media.

1. On the repository page, go to the settings tab.

    ![Settings Tab](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/hackathon_templates/assets/92253071/49f47c15-c63e-4d65-b711-3c9921238a76)

2. Scroll down to the **social preview** section. Here we can upload an image that will be used when we share our repository. Images should be a minimum of 640 x 320px, but for best results use an image that is 1280x640px.

## About Section

We can also add in some further details on the main repository page in the about section on the right hand side.
