# Setting up the Repository for Social Sharing

Follow the steps below to have your repository looking its best when sharing on socials!

## Social Preview

We can customise the image used as the preview when sharing our repository link on social media.

1. On the repository page, go to the settings tab.

2. Scroll down to the **social preview** section. Here we can upload an image that will be used when we share our repository. Images should be a minimum of 640 x 320px, but for best results use an image that is 1280x640px.

3. Click the edit button, and then select Upload an image.

## About Section

We can also add in some further details on the main repository page in the about section on the right hand side.

1. Click the cog icon next to the about section.

2. A pop-up will display. From here you can add:

    * A description about the project, this will be used as part of the preview when you share to social media.
    * The live site link or select the checkbox to use the GitHub Pages website if you've deployed using GitHub Pages.
    * Topics that relate to your project - such as languages used, hackathon etc.
