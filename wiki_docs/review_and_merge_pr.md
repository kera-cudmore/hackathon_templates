# Review & Merge a Pull Request

As an added layer of security on the original repo, collaborators will be required to review a pull request before it can be merged with the original repo. Find out how to do this below:

# Review a Pull Request

1. Go to the original repo **repo link here** and select the pull requests tab.

2. Select a pull request you would like to review.

3. On the pull request, click the files changed tab, this will allow you to review the changes made to each file. 

    Comments can be made on the files directly by hovering on the line and then clicking the blue comment icon.

    Once you have reviewed a file, you can collapse the file contents by selecting the viewed checkbox on the files header.

4. Once you have reviewed the changes made, you're ready to start the review process by clicking the start review button (this may say review changes if you have already begun the review process).

5. You will now be presented with a comment box to leave your feedback along with a choice of three radio buttons:

    * **Comment** - This will allow you to leave a comment on the PR, but will not start the approval process.

    * **Approve** - This will submit your feedback given in the comments section and approve the PR for merging.

    * **Request Changes** - This will submit your feedback given in the comments section on issues that require addressing before the code can be approved and merged.

6. Once you have left your feedback and selected whether to comment, approve or request changes you can now submit the review by clicking the green submit review button.

# Merge a Pull Request

1. You should now see a green merge pull request button.

2. To merge the changes from the pull request into the original repo click this button. This will then close the pull request.
