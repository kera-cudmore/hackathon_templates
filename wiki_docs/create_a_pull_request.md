# Create a Pull Request

When working collaboratively, the workflow is slightly different to get your changes merged into the original project repo.

You will use the git commands add, commit and push as you normally do, however there will now be an additional step - the Pull Request!

1. Once you've pushed your work, head to the **add repo link here** original repo.

2. Click the Pull Requests tab on the top of the repo. You should now see a banner at the top of the page with your branch details and to the right a green compare and pull request button.

3. Click the <kbd>Compare & Pull Request</kbd> button to begin your pull request.

4. This will now display the pull request template. Simply follow the instructions in the template, replacing the placeholder text with your information - such as a description of the changes you have made, whether there are any breaking changes and adding some images/gifs if available.

5. Click the green create pull request button to submit your pull request.
